Thumbnails resized with:
$ convert -resize 200x200\> infile.jpg outfile.jpg

\> at the end makes it only resize if the x or y dimension is larger than specified (200) (i.e., shrink only, don't enlarge); aspect ratio is not changed, so the longest side will match its dimension while the other may be smaller.
