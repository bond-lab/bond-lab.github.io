<h1>First Call for papers
<br><a href='index.html'>HPSG 2015</a></h1>
<h2>NTU, Singapore, 10-14 August 2015</h2>
</center>

<p>Abstracts are solicited for presentations which address linguistic,
foundational, or computational issues relating to or in the spirit of
the framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar.

<h3>Conference Format:</h3>

There will be two sessions: a main session, with 30 minute
presentations, and a poster session. The poster session is intended as
a means of encouraging the presentation of work that is not yet fully
mature.

Prospective speakers may submit either a 5 page abstract for the main
session, or a 2 page abstract for the poster session. Abstracts
submitted initially for the main session may be accepted, at the
discretion of the program committee, for presentation in the poster
session instead.


<h3>Venue and Related Events</h3>

The HPSG Conference will take place at Nanyang Technological University,
Singapore, 10-12 August 2015

<h4>DELPH-IN Summit:</h4>
