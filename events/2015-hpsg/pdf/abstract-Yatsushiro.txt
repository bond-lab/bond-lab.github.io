Title: The Reverse Partitive Construction in Japanese
Speaker: Kazuko Yatsushiro

In Japanese noun phrases, quantificational expressions are frequently
marked with genitive case. Genitive case attached to nouns marks
possession or partitivity, but on quantifiers it has been regarded as
purely morphological. We show that genitive case on quantifiers can be
analyzed as regular genitive case, and identify three distinct
derivations. Two of these derivations proceed from an underlying
partitive structure. We claim that the genitive particle can be
stranded by NP ellipsis, and then attaches to a quantifier. Our
analysis therefore supports an analysis of partitives, assuming two NP
positions where ellipsis can target one or both of those two NPs.
