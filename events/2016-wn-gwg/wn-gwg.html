<h1>How to add a wordnet to the GWG</h1>


<p>This is preliminary page describing how to add a wordnet to the global wordnet grid.

<ol>
  <li>Send a URL pointing to a well formed LMF version of a wordnet
  to <tt>gwgcili@gmail.com</tt> <!-- FIXME: GWG mail address --> and
  asked to be added.  Someone from your project should be a member of
  the GWA.  Currently we have no formal requirements for deciding who
  to add: the ILI maintainers (Bond, McCrae, Vossen and Fellbaum) decide.
    <br>(in the future, you will upload it somewhere instead of email)
  <li>We will download it and:
    <ol>
      <li>Validate it
	<br><b>if it is invalid, we will produce an error report</b>
      <li>Check the content for some common problems (like duplicate lemmas)
	<br><b>if we find any, we will produce an error report</b> but we
	can still load it
      <li>Merge it with the ILI and other wordnets to produce the Global Wordnet Grid
	<ul>
	  <li>Also known as the Open Multilingual Wordnet
	  <li>All entries will be linked to the project (or projects)
	  that produced them
	</ul>
      <li>Identify new ILI candidates
      <li>Produce a single downloadable linked multilingual wordnet
    </ol>
</ol>


<h3>Wordnet formatting requirements</h3>

<p>The wordnet should be formatted as valid Simple) wordnet-LMF, using
the DTD provided.

<h4>MetaData</h4>

This should include:
<pre>
project name
short project name (up to six of [-a-z])
license
url
version
release date
</pre>

<h4>Valid licenses</h4>

<p>The licence must be open</a> according to
the <a href='http://opendefinition.org/'>open definition</a>.
<ul>
  <li>Preferred licenses are:
    <ul>
      <li>Creative Commons Attribution
      <li>Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike
    </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Requirement to be added to the ILI</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The synset in your wordnet has a valid definition in English
    <ul>
      <li>The definition is written according to the guidelines and is not
	too similar to an existing definition.
    </ul>
  <li>The synset is linked to a synset linked to the ILI
    by an acceptable link
    <ul>
      <li>synonym, hypernym, antonym or meronym
    </ul>
  <li>It has a confidence score of 100 (or no confidence given)
  <li>It is not a duplicate of a concept already in the ILI
    <ul>
      <li>Checked automatically
      <li>No one objects during a trail period (three months)
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Other changes to the ILI</h3>

<p>There are three other ways to change the ILI
